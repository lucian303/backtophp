{"google":"UA-35162839-1","body":"backtophp is a project whose initial goal is to create an application that will process Smarty templates and render them back into usable PHP. Eventually, Twig and possibly other templating engines will be supported.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous reasons for the necessity of this tool. Using templating languages in PHP, which is a templating language itself, is stupid and puts extra burden on both the developers and the system. The developers have to learn yet another useless language and the system has to process the templates, sometimes taking up a significant percentage of they total request processing time.\r\n\r\nThus the time has come for change. Feel free to join me on this journey and let's try to improve development practices and systems while teaching people about the importance of simplicity in design.\r\n\r\nhttp://backtophp.com/\r\n\r\n--lucian303","note":"Don't delete this file!
